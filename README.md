# Yottaa eComet Plugin for Heroku (Beta)

Yottaa Site Optimizer will speed up your Heroku app automatically.  Faster sites have lower bounce rate, higher conversion rate, and more sales.

Whether you're already a Yottaa Site Optimizer user or want to try it for the first time, you'll enjoy the ease of having a Yottaa control panel right on your add-on dashboard. Add-on users also have access to special caching features only available through the Heroku eComet plugin, which can improve page speed even beyond Yottaa Site Optimizer's standard techniques.
